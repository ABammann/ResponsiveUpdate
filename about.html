          I was born and raised in Brazil, specifically in a small city called
          Louveira. There I followed my basic education, in the city of SÃ£o
          Paulo. At 18 years old I moved to Germany to follow my then dream of
          becoming a doctor!

          While in Germany I worked as an intern at the local hospital, in Bonn.
          I had the pleasure of meeting many people, as well as learning a lot
          about the medical world. During that time I was offered to follow the
          nursing school. However, that was not my plan. After almost two years
          living in Germany, I decided to move to the Netherlands in order to
          follow a specific study.

          While in the Netherlands I followed a study of Applied Science called
          Animal Management, learned Dutch, gave classes, got two pet bunnies
          and much more. I also got marriedðŸŒ»! After some 5 years there, I moved
          to Belgium with my husband.

          In Belgium since the end of 2017, I have worked a several places.
          Currently I work in retail, mainly focused in the area of logistics.
          In 2020 I had the pleasure of shortly (3 months) living in Australia.
          That was an unique and wonderful experience.

      While I am busy with my logisctis work I have decided to learn about
      coding. It seemed like a fascinating work, as well as a great new
      challenge in life. Thanks to
      <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/">SheCodes</a> I have learned so much!
      And I am underway to learn so much more. Please have a look at my Projects
      page to see what I have been able to accomplish till now.
